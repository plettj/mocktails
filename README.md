# Conrad Grebel Mocktails Event [Summer '25]

This repo holds analysis of votes on the three dishes that made up Apartment 3503's Cookoff.

See the [Results](/RESULTS.md) file for a summary of the data.

### What is Mocktails?

Each term at Conrad Grebel University College, upper-year students in the apartments host a Mocktails event where they serve non-alcoholic drinks to all the younger-years living in the Conrad Grebel residence.

This year, my apartment and I served ~~water~~ Super-fancy Ultra-pricey well-researched farm-fresh free-range very tasty high-tech not-from-the-caf original palette-cleansing DRINK (100% off w/CASH!) as our Mocktail.

We also hosted **_A Cookoff!_**

### Cookoff Details

Here's what we cooked:

- Josiah cooked Gourmet Quesadillas
- Peter cooked a Mushroom Stew
- Michael cooked

Then, we got everyone to vote on the Texture, Flavour, Presentation, Overall Cohesion, and "Who made it?" for each of the dishes.\

This repo holds analysis of that vote.
